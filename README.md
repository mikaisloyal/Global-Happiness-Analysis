## Project Overview
Welcome to the World Happiness Index Data Analysis project repository. This project was developed as the final assignment for the Data 101 course and aims to analyze and visualize the World Happiness Report dataset. The report highlights the importance of happiness and well-being in governmental policies by evaluating various factors that contribute to happiness across different countries.

## About the Dataset
The dataset used in this project is derived from the Gallup World Poll, specifically focusing on responses to the Cantril ladder question. This question asks respondents to rate their current lives on a scale from 0 (worst possible life) to 10 (best possible life). The dataset includes six key factors that influence happiness:
1. Economic production (GDP per capita)
2. Social support
3. Life expectancy
4. Freedom to make life choices
5. Absence of corruption
6. Generosity

## Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to analyze the World Happiness Report data and present key insights through comprehensive visualizations. By doing so, the project aims to:
- Identify the top and bottom countries based on their happiness scores.
- Examine the correlation between various factors and the overall happiness score.
- Highlight key determinants of happiness and their relative importance.

## Key Findings
- **Top 5 Happiest Countries**: Finland, Denmark, Switzerland, Iceland, Netherlands.
- **Bottom 5 Unhappiest Countries**: Lesotho, Botswana, Rwanda, Zimbabwe, Afghanistan.
- **Determinants of Happiness**: GDP per capita, social support, and healthy life expectancy are the most influential factors.
